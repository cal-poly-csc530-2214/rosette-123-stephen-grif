# 530 Rosette HW

We worked on installing rosette and ran into some issues with raco and DrRacket. After installing rosette, we spent some time looking through the homework assignment and understanding section 1 and the Rosette procedures associated with it. In particular we focused on the vc (verification condition) and the (=> and <=> procedures) which took some time getting used to. 

Afterwards we got started on problem 1 and was able to finish it and provided testing in `classify.rkt`. Then we worked on problem 2 and the solution is in `hw1_2_tseitin.rkt`.

Finally, we worked on problem 6 and 7 which was about turning k-coloring graph problems into CNF form. We finished problem 6 and our answers are up in `530_rosette_hw1.pdf` and we theorized about problem 7 but ran into blockers pertaining about understanding the given code and the types associated with rosette.
